/*----------------------------- Event Listeners -----------------------------*/

//  Set up an event listener on it that responds to the 'click' event 
// On the 'click' event, it should call the handleClick function 
// If you use this method, youâ€™ll need to ensure the element the user clicks is a square! If they click anywhere else on the board, return out of the function to disallow the move 
// This can be accomplished more easily once you obtain the index of the square clicked in the next step!

// Obtain the index of the clicked square. To do this, get the index from an id assigned to the target element in the HTML
// Assign this to a constant called squareIndex
squareEls.forEach((element) => {
    // let index = element.target
    element.addEventListener('click', handleClick)

// Call the init function when the app loads
